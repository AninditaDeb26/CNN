# Melanoma Detection
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- This project is related to building a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) based model which can accurately detect melanoma within less amount of time. 
- This process is followed to reduce manual effect in detecting skin cancer.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). 

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11.0
- numpy 1.24.2
- pandas 1.5.2
- matplotlib 3.6.2
- tensorflow

## Conclusions
- Augmentation reduces class imbalance on a significant level.
- Data overfitting and underfitting can be handled efficiently by stopping the process when reuired.
- We don't need to prepare the data from scratch.
